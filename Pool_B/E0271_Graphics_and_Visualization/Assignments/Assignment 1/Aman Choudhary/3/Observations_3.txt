Observation for Problem 3
__________________________________________

We need to choose a color map that balances off the tradeoff between performance and aesthetics.

We can use a complex color map to improve the quality of visualtization, but it might be compute 
intensive or might involve a long if-else ladder, which would increase the time to color each pixel.
